Hello, friends. This is me saying hello with the help of my alpaca friend, well really he (she?) was just a brief acquaintance.

The site (not the alpaca) is built with Hugo and uses the [CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack-starter](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack-starter/tree/master) template. I'm using a local development workflow, not the cloud editing, "Codespaces" workflow. More on the particulars of this setup in a later post (as notes to my future self, mostly).
